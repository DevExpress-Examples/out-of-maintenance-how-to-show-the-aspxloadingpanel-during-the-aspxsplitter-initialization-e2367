# How to show the ASPxLoadingPanel during the ASPxSplitter initialization


<p>When the ASPxSplitter is initialized, it adjusts its dimensions to the proper size. Sometimes this behavior is unacceptable, but the ASPxSplitter can be hovered by the ASPxLoadingPanel and moved beyond page borders. After the ASPxSplitter has been initialized, the loading panel is hidden, and the ASPxSplitter is returned to the original place.</p>
